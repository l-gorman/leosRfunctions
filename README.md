# LÃ©o's Useful R functons

There are some functions that I use quite regularly. I have made this package to make some of these functions a little more portable for anybody else who would like to use them.

If anyone has anything they would like to see, please say so in the discussion! Describe your problem in as much detail as possible and I will try to add this to the package if I can.

To install, use the following command from the `devtools` R library:

`install_github(https://github.com/l-gorman/leosRfunctions)`
